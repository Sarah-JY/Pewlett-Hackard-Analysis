# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis: 
The purpose of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in mentorship programs.  Then summarize the analysis to help Bobby’s manager prepare for the upcoming “silver tsunami”as many current employees are reaching their retirement age.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
